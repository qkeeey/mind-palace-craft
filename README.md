# Mind Palace - AI-Powered Memory Enhancement System

An intelligent web application that transforms learning materials into memorable experiences using the ancient Memory Palace technique, enhanced by modern AI.

## üéØ The Problem

The Memory Palace technique is proven effective by top memory competitors, but requires significant creativity and mental effort. Most learners struggle to create vivid associations and structured mental spaces on their own.

## üí° Our Solution

Mind Palace uses AI to automate the creative heavy-lifting, making this powerful memorization technique accessible to everyone. Simply upload your study materials, and our system generates a complete memory palace with vivid, memorable associations.

## üèóÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Upload PDFs** - Add your study materials (textbooks, notes, papers)
2. **Create Rooms** - Upload room objects photos or auto-detect objects from single room image
3. **AI Generation** - System creates associations between room objects and concepts
4. **Study & Review** - Walk through your memory palace with interactive visualizations

### AI Technologies Used

| Technology | Model/Tool | Purpose |
|------------|------------|---------|
| **Vision AI** | Llama 4 Vision (Groq API) | Analyze room images, detect objects, generate labels |
| **Language AI** | Llama 4 17B | Create mnemonic associations, concept extraction |
| **Image Generation** | Qwen Image Edit (fal.ai API) | Extract individual objects from room photos |

### Core Techniques

- **Prompt Engineering** - Crafted prompts for Turkish output, story-based associations (4-6 sentences), vivid imagery
- **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)** - Context-aware answers using vector similarity search
- **OCR + Vision** - Hybrid approach: PyMuPDF for text extraction, Groq Vision for complex documents
- **Story Chaining** - Sequential associations that flow naturally from one object to the next
- **Multi-modal AI** - Combines text, images, and spatial relationships for enhanced memory
