The Greeks 800-300 BC

Early Greek civilization was centered around the Aegean Sea. Between 800 and 300 BC, Greek culture flourished and made lasting contributions to Western civilization.

Colonization and Expansion
From about 750 BC, the Greeks began establishing colonies around the Mediterranean and Black Sea coasts. This colonization was driven by overpopulation, land hunger, and the search for trade opportunities. Major colonies were established in Sicily, southern Italy (Magna Graecia), the Black Sea region, and along the coasts of modern-day France and Spain.

City-States and Political Development
Greek society was organized into independent city-states, or poleis. Each polis had its own government, laws, and military. The two most powerful were Athens and Sparta. Athens developed the world's first democracy around 508 BC under Cleisthenes, where male citizens could participate in government. Sparta, by contrast, maintained a rigid military oligarchy focused on warfare and discipline.

The Persian Wars
Between 499-449 BC, the Greek city-states faced invasion from the Persian Empire. Key battles included Marathon (490 BC), where Athenians defeated a much larger Persian force, and Thermopylae and Salamis (480 BC), where Greek forces, led by Sparta and Athens respectively, repelled Persian invasions. These victories preserved Greek independence and allowed their culture to flourish.

The Peloponnesian War
From 431-404 BC, Athens and Sparta fought for supremacy in Greece. This devastating conflict weakened both powers and eventually led to Spartan victory. However, the war exhausted the Greek city-states and left them vulnerable to outside conquest. The conflict was chronicled by the historian Thucydides, who analyzed the causes and consequences of the war.

Cultural Achievements
This period saw remarkable achievements in philosophy (Socrates, Plato, Aristotle), drama (Sophocles, Euripides, Aristophanes), history (Herodotus, Thucydides), and science (Pythagoras, Hippocrates). The Greeks also excelled in architecture, as evidenced by the Parthenon in Athens, and sculpture, creating idealized representations of the human form.
